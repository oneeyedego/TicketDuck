### TicketSummaryTool
A lightweight tool that helps you make your messy stream-of-consciousness more coherent.
The hope being that you'll thank yourself later.
There's no one right way to use this tool, but here's a suggestion:
1. Incident Reports: What happened? What did you do? Why did you do it? Did it work? What did you learn?
2. Commit Messages: What did you do? Why did you do it? What did you learn?
3. Service Requests: What do you want? Why do you want it? What will you do with it?
